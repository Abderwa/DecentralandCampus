# DecentralandCampus
Hello.
This is my college campus created using the Decentraland builder. The buidlings were created using and combining pieces given in the builder. And some were downloaded online in Sketchfab.com. I used Fusion 360 to design the university logo and upload it to the builder.
You can find tons of 3D models online and can easily upload them to the builder. Keep in mind they have to be glTF (GL Transmission Format) and do not go over Scene limitations.
To acces the code for the Scene. Go to /src/game.ts.
Pictures inside the sceane are and example of how you can show your NFTs and advertise them.
Please see Campus.jpg to have an idea of how it looks.
